The hours/certifications spreadsheet's first must have the following cells:
	In the first column, a cell titled "Name"
	In the same row as "Name", a cell titled "Lab Hours"
	In the first column, every member's first and last name in a different cell.
	In the same column as "Lab Hours", a cell for each member that contains a decimal or integer.
	Members with zero lab hours must have a 0.0 in their "Lab Hours" cell.

Members' passcodes must be a maximum of 4 digits.

Whenever a member logs in, if they are the first member to log in that day, the rest of the data is cleared.
Therefore, if a member does not log out before 12:00am, their hours are erased.
